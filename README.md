# StudentGrades
 This Java project consists of two classes: Grades and Student. The Grades class allows the user to input student data, including name, address, and GPA, which are stored in a linked list and then sorted and saved to a text file. The Student class defines a student object with getters and setters for name, address, and GPA, enabling data encapsulation and manipulation within the Grades class.
